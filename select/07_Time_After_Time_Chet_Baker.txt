Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky
To be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening
When the day is through

I only know
What I know
The passing years
Will show

You've kept my love
So young
So new

And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky
To be loving you

(Instrumental)
