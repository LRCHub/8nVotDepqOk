I don't care if you're hard to know
I don't mind if you come and go
You hang around and get your thrills
Taking all of your fancy pills

You're the great pretender
A hero of your gender

Always something new to me
A changing personality
I like to watch your picture show
When you do your fake Monroe

You're the great pretender
A hero of your gender

Time after time
You pretend, but you don't listen
Time after time
You arrive another person

You look so chic in the clothes you wear
Always teasing your colored hair
I don't care if you're hard to know
You're starring in my video

You're the great pretender
A hero of your gender

Time after time
You pretend, but you don't listen
Time after time
You arrive another person

Time after time
You pretend, but you don't listen
Time after time
You arrive another person

You're the great pretender
A hero of your gender

Time after time
You pretend, but you don't listen
Time after time
You arrive another person

Time after time
You pretend, but you don't listen, no
Time after time
You arrive another person

Time after time
You pretend, but you don't listen
Time after time
You arrive another person

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time, after time
Time after time, after time
Time after time, after time, after time
Time after time, after time, after time
